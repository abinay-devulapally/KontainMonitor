For example, are you looking for:\n\n*   **A specific task?** (e.g., \"Write a function that calculates the factorial of a number\")\n*   **A general type of program?** (e.g., \"Write a simple web server,\" \"Write a program to read data from a file\")\n*   **Something to learn from?** (e.g., \"Write an example of using a decorator,\" \"Write an example of implementing a binary search\")\n*   **Something fun?** (e.g., \"Write a simple text-based game\")\n\nThe more details you can provide, the better I can assist you. Tell me what you want the code to do!\n",

    "content": "Okay, here are a few sample Python code snippets covering different basic areas:\n\n**1. Simple \"Hello, World!\"**\n\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\n```\n\nThis is the classic introductory program.  It simply prints the text \"Hello, World!\" to the console.\n\n**2. Function to calculate the sum of a list of numbers:**\n\n```python\ndef sum_list(numbers):\n  \"\"\"Calculates the sum of a list of numbers.\n\n  Args:\n    numbers: A list of numbers (integers or floats).\n\n  Returns:\n    The sum of the numbers in the list.  Returns 0 if the list is empty.\n  \"\"\"\n  total = 0\n  for number in numbers:\n    total += number\n  return total\n\n# Example usage\nmy_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = sum_list(my_numbers)\nprint(f\"The sum of the list is: {result}\")  # Output: The sum of the list is: 15\n```\n\nThis demonstrates a function definition, a loop, and basic arithmetic.  It also includes a docstring to explain what the function does.\n\n**3. Reading from a file:**\n\n```python\ntry:\n  with open(\"my_file.txt\", \"r\") as file:  # Replace \"my_file.txt\" with your file name\n    for line in file:\n      print(line.strip())  # Print each line after removing leading/trailing whitespace\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n  print(\"Error: File not found.\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n  print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n```\n\nThis shows how to open a file, read it line by line, and handle potential errors (like the file not existing).  It's important to use a `try...except` block for error handling. The `with open(...)` statement ensures the file is properly closed even if errors occur.\n\n**4. Simple conditional statement:**\n\n```python\nage = 20\nif age >= 18:\n  print(\"You are an adult.\")\nelse:\n  print(\"You are not an adult.\")\n```\n\nThis illustrates an `if...else` statement, a fundamental concept in programming for making decisions based on conditions.\n\n**5.  List Comprehension:**\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nsquares = [x**2 for x in numbers]  # Create a list of the squares of the numbers\nprint(squares)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n```\n\nList comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. This example creates a new list containing the squares of the numbers in the original list.\n\n**6. Dictionary Example:**\n\n```python\nperson = {\n    \"name\": \"Alice\",\n    \"age\": 30,\n    \"city\": \"New York\"\n}\n\nprint(f\"Name: {person['name']}\")\nprint(f\"Age: {person['age']}\")\nprint(f\"City: {person['city']}\")\n```\n\nThis demonstrates how to create and access elements within a dictionary, which is a key-value data structure.\n\nThese are just a few basic examples.  Let me know if you'd like to see code for something more specific!  For example, do you want to see something using:\n\n*   **Specific libraries** (e.g., `requests`, `pandas`, `numpy`)\n*   **Object-oriented programming** (classes and objects)\n*   **More complex algorithms**\n*   **Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)**\n*   **Web development**\n\nThe more information you give me, the better I can tailor the sample code to your needs.\n",
