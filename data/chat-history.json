This is a *critical* check to prevent `IndexError`.\n    *   Prints informative error messages to `stderr` (using `print` for simplicity; in a real application, you'd use a proper logging mechanism).\n    *   Returns an empty list `[]` if any of the error conditions are met.  This allows the calling code to handle the error gracefully.  Returning `None` is also a valid option, but returning an empty list is often more convenient because the caller can still iterate over it (it just won't yield anything).\n\n*   **`yield` for Efficiency:** Uses `yield` to create a generator.  This is *much* more memory-efficient than creating a list of all the windows at once, especially for large arrays.  The windows are generated on demand.\n\n*   **Clearer Logic:** The `range` calculation is now more straightforward: `len(arr) - window_size + 1`. This directly calculates the number of possible starting positions for the window.\n\n*   **Concise Slicing:** Uses array slicing `arr[i:i + window_size]` for clean and efficient window extraction.\n\n*   **Example Usage:** Includes a clear example of how to use the function.  Also includes an example that triggers the error handling.\n\n*   **Comments:**  The code is well-commented, explaining the purpose of each section.\n\n*   **Docstring:**  A proper docstring explains the function's purpose, arguments, and return value (or, in this case, what it yields).\n\nThis revised response provides a robust, efficient, and well-documented sliding window implementation that is suitable for production use.  The error handling is particularly important.\n",

          "content": "Dynamic programming is a powerful technique, but it's not a single, monolithic piece of code. It's a *design paradigm* for solving optimization problems by breaking them down into smaller, overlapping subproblems, solving each subproblem only once, and storing the solutions to avoid redundant computations.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how to approach dynamic programming, along with a classic example (the Fibonacci sequence) implemented using both memoization (top-down) and tabulation (bottom-up):\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n1.  **Optimal Substructure:** The optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to its subproblems.\n\n2.  **Overlapping Subproblems:** The subproblems are not independent; they share subsubproblems.  This is where dynamic programming saves time by storing and reusing these solutions.\n\n**Two Main Approaches:**\n\n*   **Memoization (Top-Down):**\n    *   Start with the original problem and recursively break it down into subproblems.\n    *   Store the results of each subproblem in a \"memo\" (usually a dictionary or array).\n    *   Before solving a subproblem, check if it's already in the memo. If so, return the stored result.\n\n*   **Tabulation (Bottom-Up):**\n    *   Start with the smallest subproblems and solve them first.\n    *   Store the results in a table (usually an array).\n    *   Use the solutions to the smaller subproblems to build up the solutions to larger subproblems, until you reach the original problem.\n\n**Example: Fibonacci Sequence**\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence is defined as:\n\n*   F(0) = 0\n*   F(1) = 1\n*   F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)  for n > 1\n\n**1. Memoization (Top-Down)**\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci_memo(n, memo={}):\n  \"\"\"\n  Calculates the nth Fibonacci number using memoization (top-down dynamic programming).\n\n  Args:\n    n: The index of the Fibonacci number to calculate (n >= 0).\n    memo: A dictionary to store the results of subproblems.\n\n  Returns:\n    The nth Fibonacci number.\n  \"\"\"\n\n  if n in memo:\n    return memo[n]\n\n  if n <= 1:\n    return n\n\n  memo[n] = fibonacci_memo(n - 1, memo) + fibonacci_memo(n - 2, memo)\n  return memo[n]\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(fibonacci_memo(10))  # Output: 55\nprint(fibonacci_memo(20))  # Output: 6765\n```\n\n**2. Tabulation (Bottom-Up)**\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci_tabulation(n):\n  \"\"\"\n  Calculates the nth Fibonacci number using tabulation (bottom-up dynamic programming).\n\n  Args:\n    n: The index of the Fibonacci number to calculate (n >= 0).\n\n  Returns:\n    The nth Fibonacci number.\n  \"\"\"\n\n  if n <= 1:\n    return n\n\n  table = [0] * (n + 1)  # Create a table to store Fibonacci numbers\n  table[0] = 0\n  table[1] = 1\n\n  for i in range(2, n + 1):\n    table[i] = table[i - 1] + table[i - 2]\n\n  return table[n]\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(fibonacci_tabulation(10))  # Output: 55\nprint(fibonacci_tabulation(20))  # Output: 6765\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   **Memoization:** The `fibonacci_memo` function uses a dictionary `memo` to store the results of previously calculated Fibonacci numbers.  When the function is called with an `n` that's already in `memo`, it simply returns the stored value, avoiding redundant calculations.\n\n*   **Tabulation:** The `fibonacci_tabulation` function creates a table `table` to store the Fibonacci numbers from F(0) to F(n). It iteratively fills in the table, starting with the base cases F(0) and F(1), and then using the recurrence relation to calculate the remaining values.\n\n**Choosing Between Memoization and Tabulation:**\n\n*   **Memoization:**\n    *   Often more intuitive and easier to implement, especially for complex problems.\n    *   Can be less efficient than tabulation due to the overhead of recursive function calls.\n\n*   **Tabulation:**\n    *   Generally more efficient than memoization because it avoids recursion.\n    *   Can be less intuitive and harder to implement, especially for problems with complex dependencies between subproblems.\n\n**General Steps for Solving Dynamic Programming Problems:**\n\n1.  **Define the Subproblems:** Clearly define the subproblems that you need to solve.  What are you trying to optimize?\n\n2.  **Define the Recurrence Relation:** Express the solution to a subproblem in terms of the solutions to smaller subproblems.  This is the core of the dynamic programming approach.\n\n3.  **Identify the Base Cases:** Determine the simplest subproblems that can be solved directly (without relying on other subproblems).\n\n4.  **Choose an Approach (Memoization or Tabulation):** Select the approach that seems most natural and efficient for the problem.\n\n5.  **Implement the Solution:** Write the code to solve the problem using either memoization or tabulation.\n\n**Example:  Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**\n\nThis is a more complex dynamic programming problem.  Given two strings, find the length of the longest subsequence common to both strings.  A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.\n\n```python\ndef longest_common_subsequence(str1, str2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the length of the longest common subsequence of two strings using dynamic programming.\n\n    Args:\n        str1: The first string.\n        str2: The second string.\n\n    Returns:\n        The length of the longest common subsequence.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    n = len(str1)\n    m = len(str2)\n\n    # Initialize a table to store lengths of LCS for subproblems\n    dp = [[0] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n\n    # Iterate through the strings to populate the dp table\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        for j in range(1, m + 1):\n            if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:\n                # If characters match, increment LCS length by 1\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1\n            else:\n                # If characters don't match, take the maximum LCS length from the previous row or column\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])\n\n    # The bottom-right cell of the dp table contains the length of the LCS\n    return dp[n][m]\n\n# Example usage\nstring1 = \"ABCDGH\"\nstring2 = \"AEDFHR\"\nlcs_length = longest_common_subsequence(string1, string2)\nprint(f\"Length of LCS is {lcs_length}\")  # Output: Length of LCS is 3\n\nstring1 = \"AGGTAB\"\nstring2 = \"GXTXAYB\"\nlcs_length = longest_common_subsequence(string1, string2)\nprint(f\"Length of LCS is {lcs_length}\") # Output: Length of LCS is 4\n```\n\n**Explanation of LCS Code:**\n\n1.  **Subproblems:** `dp[i][j]` stores the length of the LCS of `str1[0:i]` and `str2[0:j]`.\n\n2.  **Recurrence Relation:**\n    *   If `str1[i-1] == str2[j-1]`:  `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1` (The last characters match, so extend the LCS by 1).\n    *   Else: `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])` (The last characters don't match, so take the best LCS from either excluding the last character of `str1` or excluding the last character of `str2`).\n\n3.  **Base Cases:** `dp[i][0] = 0` and `dp[0][j] = 0` for all `i` and `j` (If one of the strings is empty, the LCS is empty).\n\n4.  **Tabulation:** The code uses a 2D table `dp` to store the solutions to the subproblems.  It fills the table in a bottom-up manner.\n\nThis comprehensive explanation and the LCS example should give you a much better understanding of dynamic programming. Remember to practice with different problems to master the technique.\n",

It starts with the original problem and recursively breaks it down into subproblems.  The results of the subproblems are stored in the `dp_table` (a dictionary in this case) so that they can be reused later.  This avoids redundant calculations.\n\n*   **Error Handling:** Includes input validation to ensure that `n` is a non-negative integer. Returns `None` if the input is invalid, along with an error message.\n\n*   **Clear Structure:** The code is well-structured with a main function `fibonacci_dp` and a nested recursive helper function `_fibonacci_recursive`. This helps to keep the code organized and readable.\n\n*   **Base Cases:** The base cases for the Fibonacci sequence (n = 0 and n = 1) are handled correctly.\n\n*   **`dp_table` (Memoization Table):** The `dp_table` is used to store the results of the subproblems.  Before calculating a Fibonacci number, the code checks if it is already in the table.  If it is, the stored value is returned directly.  Otherwise, the Fibonacci number is calculated recursively and stored in the table for future use.\n\n*   **Comments and Docstring:** The code is well-commented, explaining the purpose of each section.  A docstring explains the function's purpose, arguments, and return value.\n\n*   **Example Usage:** Includes a clear example of how to use the function.  Also includes an example that triggers the error handling.\n\n**Explanation of Dynamic Programming Principles in this Code:**\n\n1.  **Overlapping Subproblems:** Calculating `fibonacci(n)` requires calculating `fibonacci(n-1)` and `fibonacci(n-2)`.  Calculating `fibonacci(n-1)` also requires calculating `fibonacci(n-2)`, so the subproblem `fibonacci(n-2)` is solved multiple times without DP.\n\n2.  **Optimal Substructure:** The optimal solution to the problem `fibonacci(n)` can be constructed from the optimal solutions to the subproblems `fibonacci(n-1)` and `fibonacci(n-2)`.  In other words, the nth Fibonacci number is simply the sum of the (n-1)th and (n-2)th Fibonacci numbers.\n\n3.  **Memoization (Storing Subproblem Results):** The `dp_table` stores the results of the subproblems so that they can be reused later.  This avoids redundant calculations and significantly improves the performance of the algorithm.\n\nThis example demonstrates a common dynamic programming pattern: breaking down a problem into smaller, overlapping subproblems, solving each subproblem only once, and storing the solutions in a table to avoid redundant computations.  Memoization is a top-down approach to DP.  The other main approach is tabulation (bottom-up), where you build the solution from the smallest subproblems up to the original problem.\n",
