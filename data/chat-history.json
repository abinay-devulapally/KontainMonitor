This is crucial for maintainability.\n*   **Handles Edge Case:** The `if k > len(arr): return []` handles the case where the window size is larger than the input array, preventing errors.  Returning an empty list is a reasonable choice in this scenario.\n*   **Efficient Calculation:**  Instead of recalculating the sum for each window, it subtracts the element leaving the window and adds the element entering the window. This makes the algorithm O(n) instead of O(n*k).\n*   **Clear Variable Names:**  `window_sum` is more descriptive than just `sum`.\n*   **Example Usage:** The example usage makes it easy to understand how to use the function.\n*   **f-string:** Uses an f-string for cleaner output formatting.\n\nTo make this more useful, tell me the *specific problem* you're trying to solve with a sliding window.  For example, \"find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size k in a list of integers.\"  Then I can adapt the code to your needs.\n",

This makes the code more modular, readable, and reusable.  It also makes the main `print_primes` function cleaner.\n*   **Efficiency:** The `is_prime` function only iterates up to the square root of `n`.  If a number `n` has a divisor greater than its square root, it must also have a divisor smaller than its square root. This significantly improves performance, especially for larger numbers.\n*   **Handles Edge Cases:** The `if n <= 1:` in `is_prime` correctly handles the cases where `n` is 0 or 1, which are not prime.\n*   **Clear Docstrings:**  Both functions have docstrings explaining their purpose, arguments, and return values.  This is crucial for code maintainability and understanding.\n*   **`print_primes(limit)` Function:** This function iterates from 2 up to the specified limit and prints each number that is determined to be prime by the `is_prime` function.\n*   **Example Usage:**  The example usage shows how to call the `print_primes` function and prints a descriptive message.\n*   **f-string:** Uses an f-string for cleaner output formatting.\n\nThis improved version is more efficient, readable, and robust than a simple, single-loop implementation.  It's also easier to test and maintain.\n",
